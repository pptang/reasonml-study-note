## Making impossible stylesheet impossible
- a clearer data model can lead to a clearer api
- Testing is good, impossible is better!! (can't even write a test)

- do we want two Maybes...or do we want a tailored uninon type?
- do we want two lists...or one with two fields per element
- can we revise our implementation without breaking users' builds?
